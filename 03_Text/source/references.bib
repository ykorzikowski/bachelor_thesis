            Digital proxies of human mobility and physical mixing have been used to monitor viral transmissibility and effectiveness of social distancing interventions in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a new framework that parameterizes disease transmission models with age-specific digital mobility data. By fitting the model to case data in Hong Kong, we are able to accurately track the local effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in near real time (i.e., no longer constrained by the delay of around 9 days between infection and reporting of cases) which is essential for quick assessment of the effectiveness of interventions on reducing transmissibility. Our findings show that accurate nowcast and forecast of COVID-19 epidemics can be obtained by integrating valid digital proxies of physical mixing into conventional epidemic models.},

An example is healthcare and epidemiological data such as data related to patients who suffered from epidemic diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Knowledge discovered from these epidemiological data helps researchers, epidemiologists and policy makers to get a better understanding of the disease, which may inspire them to come up ways to detect, control and combat the disease. As “a picture is worth a thousand words”, having methods to visualize and visually analyze these big data makes it easily to comprehend the data and the discovered knowledge. In this paper, we present a big data visualization and visual analytics tool for visualizing and analyzing COVID-19 epidemiological data. The tool helps users to get a better understanding of information about the confirmed cases of COVID-19. Although this tool is designed for visualization and visual analytics of epidemiological data, it is applicable to visualization and visual analytics of big data from many other real-life applications and services.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty around the role ‘super-spreaders’ play in the transmission and escalation of infectious disease is compounded by its broad and vague definition. It is a term that has been much used in relation to COVID-19, particularly in social media. On its widest definition, it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average number of people. Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this might be pertinent to almost any infected individual who is not physically isolated from others. Nor is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to spread infectious disease: it can potentially be used to describe events, policies or settings. This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic. One problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to alleged superspreaders. Another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission. The author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition.},

Our orientations and luminances are selected based on psychophysical experiments that studied how the low-level human visual system perceives these visual features. The result is an image that allows viewers to identify data values in an individual ﬁeld, while at the same time highlighting interactions between different ﬁelds. Our technique supports datasets with both smooth and sharp boundaries. It is stable in the presence of noise and missing values. Images are generated in real-time, allowing interactive exploration of the underlying data. Our technique can be combined with existing methods that use perceptual colours or perceptual texture dimensions, and can therefore be seen as an extension of these methods to further assist in the exploration and analysis of large, complex, multidimensional datasets.},

Methods: We present a sophisticated extension of a classical SEIR model. The simulation tool CovidSIM Version 1.0 is an openly accessible web interface to interactively conduct simulations of this model. The simulation tool is used to assess the effects of various interventions, assuming parameters that reflect the situation in Austria as an example.
Results: Strict contact reduction including isolation of infected persons in quarantine wards and at home can substantially delay the peak of the epidemic. Home isolation of infected individuals effectively reduces the height of the peak. Contact reduction by social distancing, e.g., by curfews, sanitary behavior, etc. are also effective in delaying the epidemic peak.
Conclusions: Contact-reducing mechanisms are efficient to delay the peak of the epidemic. They might also be effective in decreasing the peak number of infections depending on seasonal fluctuations in the transmissibility of the disease.},

Computational advances have made possible a growing number of agent-based models across a variety of application domains. Applications range from modeling agent behavior in the stock market, supply chains, and consumer markets, to predicting the spread of epidemics, mitigating the threat of bio-warfare, and understanding the factors that may be responsible for the fall of ancient civilizations. Such progress suggests the potential of ABMS to have far-reaching effects on the way that businesses use computers to support decision-making and researchers use agent-based models as electronic laboratories. Some contend that ABMS ¿is a third way of doing science¿ and could augment traditional deductive and inductive reasoning as discovery methods. This brief tutorial introduces agent-based modeling by describing the foundations of ABMS, discussing some illustrative applications, and addressing toolkits and methods for developing agent-based models.},

We contribute an understanding of, and indicators predicting how, large variations in viewing distances and viewing angles affect the accurate perception of angles, areas, and lengths. Our work, thus, helps visualization researchers with design considerations on how to create effective visualizations for these spaces. The first study showed that perception accuracy was impacted most when viewers were close to the wall but differently for each variable (Angle, Area, Length). Our second study examined the effect of perception when participants could move freely compared to when they had a static viewpoint. We found that a far but static viewpoint was as accurate but less time consuming than one that included free motion. Based on our findings, we recommend encouraging viewers to stand further back from the display when conducting perception estimation tasks. If tasks need to be conducted close to the wall display, important information should be placed directly in front of the viewer or above, and viewers should be provided with an estimation of the distortion effects predicted by our work-or encouraged to physically navigate the wall in specific ways to reduce judgement error.},

This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on graytone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in categoryidentification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

A similar rule of connectivity with hue replacing brightness was obtained by using varicolored dots of equal subjective brightness. The limitations in discriminating complex line structures were also investigated.},

Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-loadbased transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.},

	abstract = {Color induction was measured for test and inducing chromaticities presented in spatial square-wave alternation, with spatial frequencies of 0.7, 4.0, 6.0 and 9.0 cpd. Observers matched the test chromaticities to a rectangular matching ﬁeld using haploscopic presentation. Data were collected and analyzed within the framework of a cone chromaticity space, allowing analysis of spatial frequency effects on post-receptoral spectral opponent pathways. Assimilation, a shift of chromaticity toward the inducing chromaticity, was found at the highest spatial frequency (9.0 cpd). Contrast, a shift of chromaticity away from the inducing chromaticity, occurred at the lowest spatial frequency (0.7 cpd). The spatial frequency at the transition point from assimilation to contrast was near 4 cpd, independent of the cone axis. Assimilation was unaffected by the presence of a neutral surround and could be described by a spread light model. Contrast was reduced in the presence of a neutral surround. The data suggested that retinal contrast signals are important determinants in the perception of chromatic contrast. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In an earlier study by Julesz (1962) pairs of random textures were generated side-by-side using a Markov process with different third-order joint-probability distributions but identical first- and second-order distributions. Such texture pairs could not be discriminated from each other by the human visual system without scrutiny. Unfortunately, Markov processes are inherently one-dimensional while the general processes underlying visual texture discrimination are two-dimensional. Here three new methods are introduced that generate two-dimensional non-Markovian textures with different third-order but identical first- and second-order statistics. All three methods generate texture pairs that cannot be discriminated from each other.
            The lack of texture discrimination is the more astonishing since the individual elements that form the texture pair are clearly perceived as being very different. However, a counterexample was found that yields discrimination although the texture pair has approximately identical second-order statistics. This case can be explained by assuming that early feature extractors do some preprocessing. These new demonstrations give support to a model of texture discrimination in which the stimulus is first analyzed by local feature extractors that can detect only simple features such as dots and edges of given sizes and orientations. Then the outputs of these simple extractors are evaluated by a global processor that can compute only second- or first-order statistics (that is can compare at most two such outputs).},

An important consideration during visualization design is the role of human visual perception. How we “see” details in an image can directly impact a viewer’s efficiency and effectiveness. This paper surveys research on attention and visual perception, with a specific focus on results that have direct relevance to visualization and visual analytics. We discuss theories of low-level visual perception, then show how these findings form a foundation for more recent work on visual memory and visual attention. We conclude with a brief overview of how knowledge of visual attention and visual memory is being applied in visualization and graphics. We also discuss how challenges in visualization are motivating research in psychophysics.},

	abstract = {The visualization and analysis of dynamic networks have become increasingly important in several fields, for instance sociology or economics. The dynamic and multi-relational nature of this data poses the challenge of understanding both its topological structure and how it changes over time. In this paper we propose a visual analytics approach for analyzing dynamic networks that integrates: a dynamic layout with user-controlled trade-off between stability and consistency; three temporal views based on different combinations of node-link diagrams (layer superimposition, layer juxtaposition, and two-and-a-halfdimensional view); the visualization of social network analysis metrics; and specific interaction techniques for tracking node trajectories and node connectivity over time. This integration of visual, interactive, and automatic methods supports the multifaceted analysis of dynamically changing networks.},

Incoming data contain multiple variables, high signal-to-noise ratio, and a degree of uncertainty, all of which hinder exploration, hypothesis generation/exploration, and decision making. To facilitate the exploration of such data, advanced tool sets are needed that allow the user to interact with their data in a visual environment that provides direct analytic capability for finding data aberrations or hotspots. In this paper, we present a suite of tools designed to facilitate the exploration of spatiotemporal data sets. Our system allows users to search for hotspots in both space and time, combining linked views and interactive filtering to provide users with contextual information about their data and allow the user to develop and explore their hypotheses. Statistical data models and alert detection algorithms are provided to help draw user attention to critical areas.},

In this paper, we outline the scope of Visual Analytics using two problem and three methodological classes in order to workout the need for and purpose of Visual Analytics. By examples of analytic reasoning interaction, the respective advan- tages and disadvantages of automated and visual analysis methods are explained leading to a glimpse into the future of how Visual Analytics methods will enable us to go beyond what is possible when separately using the two methods.},
